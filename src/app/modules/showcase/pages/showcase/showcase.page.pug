      | Independent but complementary, a precise physiological monitoring of the climber equipped with the connected T-Shirt KlymbR, thanks to its cardiac sensor and its altimeter.
      | To free the user of his phone, the physiological data acquired via our T-Shirt are transferred to the mobile application after the session (indoor and outdoor), upon request.
    p Physiological data and performances, archived by us, are accessible in synthetic form in our web and mobile applications, configurable at the discretion of the user.
